								<p><b>Kia Ora! I’m a 21-year-old creative located in Wellington, New Zealand. I’m currently pursuing my passion for graphic design and photography at Victoria University’s School of Design Innovation. I’m thrilled to share a bit about myself and my journey with you!</b>

								</p>

								<h2>My Story</h2>
								<p>Ever since I picked up my first camera as a young teenager, I’ve been captivated by the art of visual storytelling. My love for photography sparked my desire to explore the world of graphic design. I found there were no limits in the creative world and that ideas were infinite. I could finally express myself. </p>

								<h2> Education</h2>
								<p>After graduating from Nelson College for Boys, I enrolled at Victoria University, where I’m Honing my skills as a creative. My time here has been an amazing learning experience, equipping me with the knowledge and tools to bring my creativity to new levels. I cannot wait for the further time I have left here at Victoria University.

								<h2>Passion meets Proffesion</h2>
								<p>For me, graphic design and photography aren’t just academic pursuits, they’re a passion of mine and a huge part of my life. It doesn’t matter if I’m at my desk designing a webpage, or out in the world framing the perfect shot or even in my bed making an illustration. I’m always in my element. I believe that art has the power to evoke emotions and spark conversations, and I’m dedicated to using my creative skills to make an impact.</p>

								<h2>What I Bring to the Table</h2>
								<p>As a young creative, I bring a fresh perspective and enthusiasm to every project I take on. I believe that one of the keys to success in the ever-evolving worlds of graphic design and photography is a genuine passion for learning. I'm constantly seeking out new techniques, staying up to date with new trends throughout the industry, and exploring innovative tools to expand my skill set.</p>

								<p>Attention to detail is at the heart of work. I understand that the smallest elements can make the biggest impact. Whether it's fine-tuning the colours in a design or ensuring that every aspect of a photograph is perfectly composed, I take pride in my ability to focus on the finer points that elevate the quality of my work.</p>

								<p>My dedication to learning and commitment to precision are qualities that I bring to every project, ensuring that the result not only meets but exceeds expectations. I achieve this with excellent communication throughout my design process. I believe that by combining creativity with a thirst for knowledge and an eye for finer details, I can create work that truly stands out and leaves a lasting impression. I'm excited to apply these qualities to future projects and collaborations, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of design and photography.</p>

								<h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
								<p>While I'm still on my educational journey, I have big dreams for the future. I aspire to work with innovative brands, collaborate with fellow artists, and continue evolving as a creative in this new era of design. The possibilities are limitless, and I can't wait to see where my creative path leads.</p>

								<h2>Beyond the Screen</h2>
								<p>When I'm not immersed in the world of graphic design and photography, I embrace the outdoors by going out for a run or shooting hoops. I also love the thrill of thrift shopping, there’s nothing like scouring op shops with some friends searching for hidden treasures on the racks. These hobbies not only provide me with a well-rounded perspective on life but also serve as a wellspring of inspiration for my creative work, infusing it with a unique blend of energy, authenticity, and creativity.</p>


								<h2>Let's Connect!</h2>

								<p>I'm always open to new collaborations, projects, and conversations. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work together, share ideas, or just chat about all things creative. You can connect with me through the contact form on this website or find me on Instagram at @Oliver.McIntyre

								<p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better. I can't wait to embark on this creative journey with you!</p>
